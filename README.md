# MiniJava Compiler

This programming project was created as part of the coursework for COMP 520 at UNC Chapel Hill. It is a compiler for miniJava, which is a subset of Java. Every miniJava program is a legal Java program with Java semantics. Java is also the implementation language for the compiler. 

## Project Components

The compiler is divided into 4 parts:

1. syntactic analysis
2. abstract syntax tree (AST) construction
3. type checking
4. code generation
